### Who is Karen Spellman?:

### Medical History & Background:
Karen had a history of acute back problems dating back to 2003, including multiple surgical interventions over the years between 2005 and 2006 particularly at the L4/L5 level. Her spine was described as "poor quality", with signs of canal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal).
She also suffered from long standing bladder and urinary issues, which are relevant in diagnosing Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), a condition that affects the pelvic organ function. She had problems with bladder control, including urinary retention and intermittent self-catheterisation. 
On several occasions before 2017, Karen sought medical attention for symptoms that could indicate CES: radiating back pain and neurological signs, i.e. episodes of numbness, tingling and weakness in her legs including difficulty walking and maintaining balance especially after physical restrains or falls.
She endured multiple falls prior to June 2017, each followed worsening symptoms which these incidents often triggered acute flare-ups of pain and neurological signs.
### Context:
Karen Spellman had a long history of spinal and urological issues.
After a fall at work in June 2017, she experienced radiating back pain down her legs and into her left buttock, difficulty walking and standing, and neurological symptoms consistent with CES.
She visited Queen Alexandera Hospital in Portsmouth, where an MRI was performed. The following scan was affected by movement artefact but showed mild central canal stenosis. Thereby, Doctors concluded CES was not present and discharged her the same day.
