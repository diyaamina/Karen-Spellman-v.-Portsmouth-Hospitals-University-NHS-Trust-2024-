# Karen-Spellman-v.-Portsmouth-Hospitals-University-NHS-Trust-2024-
### Who is Karen Spellman?:
Her occupation at the time of the incident aren't publically or explicitly stated in the legal documents. But she was described as having fallen at work, which suggests she was employed, possibly in a physically active or administrative role.

### Medical History & Background:
Karen had a history of acute back problems dating back to 2003, including multiple surgical interventions over the years between 2005 and 2006 particularly at the L4/L5 level. Her spine was described as "poor quality", with signs of canal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) noted in later imaging.


She also suffered from long standing bladder dysfunction and urinary issues, which are relevant in diagnosing Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), a condition that affects the pelvic organ function. She had problems with bladder control, including urinary retention which required intermittent self-catheterisation.


On several occasions before 2017, Karen sought medical attention for symptoms that could indicate CES: radiating back pain and neurological signs, i.e. episodes of numbness, tingling and weakness in her legs including difficulty walking and maintaining balance especially after physical restrains or falls. However, contemporary investigations never confirmed CES.
She endured multiple falls prior to June 2017, each followed worsening symptoms which these incidents often triggered acute flare-ups of pain and neurological signs.


It was noted that she had a complex medical history, including obesity and addiction, which may have influenced her overall health and recovery prospects.

### Context:
Karen Spellman had a long history of spinal and urological issues as discussed under her Medical History & background.
After a fall at work in June 2017, she experienced radiating back pain down her legs and into her left buttock, difficulty walking and standing, and neurological symptoms consistent with CES.


She visited Queen Alexandera Hospital in Portsmouth on the 6th June 2017. This was the day after she had a fall at work, her GP referred her to hospital after consulting with an orthopaedic registrar, and she was seen by an orthopaedic doctor who ordered an MRI scan that day. The scan was reviewed by a consultant radiologist, Dr. Witham, but was affected by movement artefact. 

Despite some mild central canal stenosis, the clinical team concluded that her symptoms were not of serious concern, and she was discharged later that day without further tests or imaging. On 12th June 2017, 6 days after being discharged as an outpatient, she sought a private spinal surgeon who diagnosed CES and performed urgent decompression surgery the same day.
### Issues:
Spellman alleged that the Trust negligently failed to identify CES on the initial MRI, delaying treatment and causing permenant harm and damage. 

The Trust argued she did not have CES at that time and that surgery wouldn't have changed the outcome.

### Legal Context:
Her hearing dates were on the 23rd till the 30th of October 2023. Cara Guthrie represented her (claiment) as instructed by Irwin Mitchell LLP, while Anna Hughes represented Pourtsmouth Hospitals NHS trust (defendant) as instructed by DAC Beachcroft.

The court classified the case as a "pure diagnosis" case, meaning the legal test focused on whether the MRI scan was interpreted reasonably, not whether the treatment was delayed or mismanaged.

The judge, Mr Justice Sweeting, applied a two step test drawn from Penny v East Kent Health Authority and Brandy v Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust:

Factual Analysis: What was actually visible on the MRI scan taken on 6th June 2017?

Bolam Test: Did the radiologist's interpretation fall within the range of views held by a responsible body of medical opinion?

The court focused on two central questions:
# Did the Trust breach its duty of care?
The MRI scan was compromised by movement artefact.
The radiologist reported mild spinal canal narrowing but did not diagnose CES.
The court applied the Bolam test, asking whether the radiologist's interpretation was reasonable by professional standards. 

# Did the delay cause harm?
Spellman underwent surgery on 12th of June, after a private diagnosis.
The court considered whether earlier surgery would have improved her outcome.
Her complex medical history (including prior spinal surgeries and chronic bladder issues) made this difficult to prove.

Key conderations included: 

The MRI was degraded by movement artefact.
The radiologist reported mild central canal stenosis, not CES.
The claimant's expert misidentified pathology at the wrong spinal level, undermining credibility.
The private surgeon who operated on 12th of June didn't request a new MRI on record consultation notes.

The court found: 

The MRI did not show acute cauda equina compression.
The radiologist's report was reasonable and defensible under the Bolam standard.
Even if the CES had been present, earlier surgery would not likely have improved the outcome, due to Spellman's complex medical history (including prior spinal surgeries and chronic urological issues)

So, while the harm was real, the legal threshold for breach and causation wasn't met. The agreed damages of £300,000 were never awarded because liability wasn't established. The court found no breach of duty and no proven causation.


### Application:

### Timeline of events:

2003: Karen Spellman first reports acute back pain and scaitcia to her GP.


2005 - 2006: Undergoes multiple spinal surgeries, especially at the L4/L5 level.


Pre-2017: Experiences recurring neurological symptoms and bladder issues.


5th June 2017: Falls at work, triggering radiating back pain and mobility problems.


6th June 2017 (AM): Consults GP, who speaks to orthopaedic registrar and refers her to the hospital.


6th June 2017 (PM): Presents at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth.


MRI scan performed but affected by movement artefact.


Consultant radiologist Dr. Witham reports mild central canal stenosis.


No diagnosis of Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES); Spellman is discharged.


7th - 11th June 2017: Symptoms worsen i.e. urinary retention, numbness, and increased pain.


12th June 2017: Seeks private spinal surgeon's opinion


Diagnosed with CES and undergoes urgent decompression surgery


No new MRI requested; no consultation notes recorded


Post 2017 - 2023: Spellman initiates legal proceedings against the NHS Trust.


31st July 2024: High Court trail held before Mr Justice Sweeting.


Claim dismissed, no breach of duty found.


28th November 2024: Case published as a "Case of Note" by NHS Resolution


### Conclusion:

### Reflection:
The court applied the Bolam standard to assess whether the radiologist acted within a reasonable body of medical opinion. But this case shows that even when clinicans follow accepted practice, patients can still suffer harm. Spellman's damages were agreed at £300,000, but without proving causation, she recieved nothing. This highlights how crucial it is to link breach of duty directly to harm. As a future lawyer, I'd want to ensure that clients understand this barrier early in the litigation process.

This case is a powerful example of how legal standards like Bolam and Montgomery shape outcomes in medical law, and how causation can be the deciding factor even when harm is evident.
