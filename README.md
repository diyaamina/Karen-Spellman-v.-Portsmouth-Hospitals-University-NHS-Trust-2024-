# Karen-Spellman-v.-Portsmouth-Hospitals-University-NHS-Trust-2024-
### Who is Karen Spellman?:
Her occupation at the time of the incident aren't publically or explicitly stated in the legal documents. But she was described as having fallen at work, which suggests she was employed, possibly in a physically active or administrative role.

### Summary of Medical History & Background:
Karen had a history of acute back problems dating back to 2003, including multiple surgical interventions over the years between 2005 and 2006 particularly at the L4/L5 level. Her spine was described as "poor quality", with signs of canal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) noted in later imaging.


She also suffered from long standing bladder dysfunction and urinary issues, which are relevant in diagnosing Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), a condition that affects the pelvic organ function. She had problems with bladder control, including urinary retention which required intermittent self-catheterisation.


On several occasions before 2017, Karen sought medical attention for symptoms that could indicate CES: radiating back pain and neurological signs, i.e. episodes of numbness, tingling and weakness in her legs including difficulty walking and maintaining balance especially after physical restrains or falls. However, contemporary investigations never confirmed CES.
She endured multiple falls prior to June 2017, each followed worsening symptoms which these incidents often triggered acute flare-ups of pain and neurological signs.


It was noted that she had a complex medical history, including obesity and addiction, which may have influenced her overall health and recovery prospects.

### Context:
Karen Spellman had a long history of spinal and urological issues as discussed under her Medical History & background.
After a fall at work in June 2017, she experienced radiating back pain down her legs and into her left buttock, difficulty walking and standing, and neurological symptoms consistent with CES.


She visited Queen Alexandera Hospital in Portsmouth on the 6th June 2017. This was the day after she had a fall at work, her GP referred her to hospital after consulting with an orthopaedic registrar, and she was seen by an orthopaedic doctor who ordered an MRI scan that day. The scan was reviewed by a consultant radiologist, Dr. Witham, but was affected by movement artefact. 

Despite some mild central canal stenosis, the clinical team concluded that her symptoms were not of serious concern, and she was discharged later that day without further tests or imaging. On 12th June 2017, 6 days after being discharged as an outpatient, she sought a private spinal surgeon who diagnosed CES and performed urgent decompression surgery the same day.

### Issues:
Spellman alleged that the Trust negligently failed to identify CES on the initial MRI, delaying treatment and causing permenant harm and damage. 

The Trust argued she did not have CES at that time and that surgery wouldn't have changed the outcome.

### Legal Context:
Her hearing dates were on the 23rd till the 30th of October 2023. Cara Guthrie represented her (claiment) as instructed by Irwin Mitchell LLP, while Anna Hughes represented Pourtsmouth Hospitals NHS trust (defendant) as instructed by DAC Beachcroft.

The court classified the case as a "pure diagnosis" case, meaning the legal test focused on whether the MRI scan was interpreted reasonably, not whether the treatment was delayed or mismanaged.

The judge, Mr Justice Sweeting, applied a two step test drawn from Penny v East Kent Health Authority and Brandy v Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust:

Factual Analysis: What was actually visible on the MRI scan taken on 6th June 2017?

Bolam Test: Did the radiologist's interpretation fall within the range of views held by a responsible body of medical opinion?

The court focused on two central questions:


Did the Trust breach its duty of care?
The MRI scan was compromised by movement artefact.
The radiologist reported mild spinal canal narrowing but did not diagnose CES.
The court applied the Bolam test, asking whether the radiologist's interpretation was reasonable by professional standards. 

Did the delay cause harm?
Spellman underwent surgery on 12th of June, after a private diagnosis.
The court considered whether earlier surgery would have improved her outcome.
Her complex medical history (including prior spinal surgeries and chronic bladder issues) made this difficult to prove.

Key conderations included: 

The MRI was degraded by movement artefact.
The radiologist reported mild central canal stenosis, not CES.
The claimant's expert misidentified pathology at the wrong spinal level, undermining credibility.
The private surgeon who operated on 12th of June didn't request a new MRI on record consultation notes.

The court found: 

The MRI did not show acute cauda equina compression.
The radiologist's report was reasonable and defensible under the Bolam standard.
Even if the CES had been present, earlier surgery would not likely have improved the outcome, due to Spellman's complex medical history (including prior spinal surgeries and chronic urological issues)

So, while the harm was real, the legal threshold for breach and causation wasn't met. The agreed damages of £300,000 were never awarded because liability wasn't established. The court found no breach of duty and no proven causation.


### Application:

Clinical Negligence Law (Tort Law):
The core of the case was a negligence claim: Spellman alleged that the Trust failed to diagnose Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) in a timely manner.
The court examined whether the hospital breached its duty of care, and whether that breach caused her harm.

Diagnostic Negligence (Pure Diagnosis Cases):
The court applied the framework from: Penny v East Kent Health Authority (2000) Lloyd's Rep Med 41, Brady v Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (2020) EWHC 158 (QB)
The cases established a two step test:
1. What was visible on the scan as a matter of fact?
2. Was the interpretation reasonable under the Bolam test?

Bolam Test:
A key standard in medical negligence: asks whether the clinician’s actions align with a responsible body of medical opinion.
The radiologist’s interpretation of the MRI was judged under this test and found to be reasonable.

Causation Law:
Even if negligence is proven, the claimant must show that it caused the harm.
The court found that earlier surgery would not likely have improved Spellman’s outcome due to her complex medical history, so causation failed.

Quantum of Damages:
Although damages were agreed at £300,000, they were not awarded because liability wasn’t established.
This reflects how quantum (amount of compensation) is separate from proving fault.

### Trail Outcome:
During the trial, expert witnesses debated whether the scan showed acute CES. The Trust maintained that the scan revealed only mild narrowing and that their interpretation met accepted clinical standards. The High Court ultimately sided with the Trust, finding no breach of duty and concluding that the claimant’s expert had misinterpreted the imaging. The claim was dismissed, and no damages were awarded.

### What could have been done differently?:

Clinically:


Repeat MRI: The original scan was compromised by movement artefact. A repeat scan could have clarified the diagnosis and reduced uncertainty.

Better Documentation: The private surgeon who diagnosed CES did not request a new MRI or record consultation notes. This weakened the credibility of the diagnosis.

Clearer Symptom Timeline: Spellman did not disclose her fall to the GP, instead reporting symptoms as having started three days earlier. This muddled the clinical picture.


Legally:


Stronger Expert Evidence: The claimant’s radiology expert misidentified pathology at the wrong spinal level, which undermined the case. More precise and credible expert testimony might have shifted the outcome.


Focus on Systemic Factors: The case didn’t explore whether NHS resource constraints (e.g. time pressure, staffing) influenced the decision to discharge. That could have opened regulatory or ethical avenues.


### Reflection:
The court applied the Bolam standard to assess whether the radiologist acted within a reasonable body of medical opinion. But this case shows that even when clinicans follow accepted practice, patients can still suffer harm. Spellman's damages were agreed at £300,000, but without proving causation, she recieved nothing. This highlights how crucial it is to link breach of duty directly to harm. 

As a future lawyer, I'd want to ensure that clients understand this barrier early in the litigation process. This case is a powerful example of how legal standards like Bolam and Montgomery shape outcomes in medical law, and how causation can be the deciding factor even when harm is evident.

If I were the involved in the legal proceedings in Karen Spellman v. Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, I would have acknowledged the clinical complexity of the case but placed greater emphasis on the ethical duty to act cautiously when diagnostic uncertainty exists. While the MRI scan was compromised by movement artefact, the presence of red flag symptoms: radiating pain, mobility issues, and a history of urological dysfunction should have triggered a more precautionary response, such as repeat imaging or short-term admission for observation. I would have issued a strong obiter statement urging NHS Trusts to adopt clearer protocols for managing borderline CES presentations, especially when scans are inconclusive. Though the legal standard under Bolam may have been met, the broader principle of patient safety demands a more proactive approach. In doing so, I would aim not only to resolve the case fairly, but to signal to the medical and legal communities that diagnostic diligence must evolve alongside clinical risk.
