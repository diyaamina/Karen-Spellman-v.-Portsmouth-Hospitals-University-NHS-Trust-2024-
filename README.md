### Who is Karen Spellman?:
Karen Spellman was born in 1964, making her approximately 61 years old as of 2025. Her occupation at the time of the incident aren't publically or explicitly stated in the legal documents. But she was described as having fallen at work, which suggests she was employed, possibly in a physically active or administrative role.

### Medical History & Background:
Karen had a history of acute back problems dating back to 2003, including multiple surgical interventions over the years between 2005 and 2006 particularly at the L4/L5 level. Her spine was described as "poor quality", with signs of canal stenosis (narrowing of the spinal canal) noted in later imaging.


She also suffered from long standing bladder dysfunction and urinary issues, which are relevant in diagnosing Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES), a condition that affects the pelvic organ function. She had problems with bladder control, including urinary retention which required intermittent self-catheterisation.


On several occasions before 2017, Karen sought medical attention for symptoms that could indicate CES: radiating back pain and neurological signs, i.e. episodes of numbness, tingling and weakness in her legs including difficulty walking and maintaining balance especially after physical restrains or falls. However, contemporary investigations never confirmed CES.
She endured multiple falls prior to June 2017, each followed worsening symptoms which these incidents often triggered acute flare-ups of pain and neurological signs.


It was noted that she had a complex medical history, including obesity and addiction, which may have influenced her overall health and recovery prospects.

### Context:
Karen Spellman had a long history of spinal and urological issues as discussed under her Medical History & background.
After a fall at work in June 2017, she experienced radiating back pain down her legs and into her left buttock, difficulty walking and standing, and neurological symptoms consistent with CES.


She visited Queen Alexandera Hospital in Portsmouth on the 6th June 2017. This was the day after she had a fall at work, her GP referred her to hospital after consulting with an orthopaedic registrar, and she was seen by an orthopaedic doctor who ordered an MRI scan that day. The scan was reviewed by a consultant radiologist, Dr. Witham, but was affected by movement artefact. 

Despite some mild central canal stenosis, the clinical team concluded that her symptoms were not of serious concern, and she was discharged later that day without further tests or imaging. On 12th June 2017, 6 days after being discharged as an outpatient, she sought a private spinal surgeon who diagnosed CES and performed urgent decompression surgery the same day.
### Issues:
Spellman alleged that the Trust negligently failed to identify CES on the initial MRI, delaying treatment and causing permenant harm and damage. 


The Trust argued she did not have CES at that time and that surgery wouldn't have changed the outcome.

### Legal Context:
Her hearing dates were on the 23rd till the 30th of October 2023. Cara Guthrie represented her (claiment) as instructed by Irwin Mitchell LLP, while Anna Hughes represented Pourtsmouth Hospitals NHS trust (defendant) as instructed by DAC Beachcroft.
